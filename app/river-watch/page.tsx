              Planning context for September 5: the NWS St. Louis river summary had advanced to the 900 AM CDT
              September 4 issuance, showing Alton at 19.4 feet and Mel Price Lock and Dam at 4.3 feet. The
              remaining official sources reviewed did not show a material update beyond the postings already
              identified yesterday. That is planning context, not a same-morning vessel-access commitment.

            <p>
              This page receives a dated morning check every day. If no material official update is available,
              the page says that directly instead of treating older conditions as new. If a source has a newer
              update, the source itself controls.
