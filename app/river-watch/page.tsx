              <strong>Morning check: September 2, 2026 at 6:34 AM CDT.</strong> Official sources reviewed this
              morning showed a newer NWS river-stage summary for the Alton and Melvin Price snapshot, while
              the latest St. Louis USACE weekly report, survey postings, and nearby district notice pages
              still pointed to late-August or early-August items already in circulation.

              Planning context for September 2: the newest official change I confirmed this morning was the
              September 1 NWS river summary, which showed Alton at 19.7 feet and Mel Price Lock and Dam at
              5.0 feet. The latest St. Louis District weekly report still showed August 26, the most recent
              nearby Middle Mississippi survey uploads reviewed remained August 20, and the active district
              notice feed still pointed to the August 2 Lock 25 construction update with daytime closures
              through September 19. That is planning context, not a same-morning vessel-access commitment.

              This page receives a dated morning check every day. If no material official update is available,
              the page says that directly instead of treating older conditions as new. If a source has a newer
              update, the source itself controls.

              River Watch is general information, not navigation advice, a safety directive, or a promise
              about vessel access, timing, or delivery availability.
